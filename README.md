## Members of Parliament

Aggregate votes by voting region and calculate the Elected Members of Parliament from each voting region. Obtain the composition of the Parliament given an election Result

## Regional Map of Most Voted Party

Show a map of Spain with voting regions, with colour coding for the most voted party in that region

## Flow of Party Votes

Calculate an election result if a shares of voters from one political party vote another political party

## Electoral Map Differences

Compare two election results and the differences of the Parliament composition

## Future Improvements

- Use different flow rates by voting region, instead of a uniform flow
- More complex voter flows
- Experiment with alternative voting systems, and see their differences given the same election result
